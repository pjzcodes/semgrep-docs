# How to connect Semgrep and DefectDojo

[DefectDojo](https://www.defectdojo.com/) is a well-known vulnerability management tool. It allows you to gather security issues from tools like Semgrep and more. By integrating Semgrep findings into DefectDojo, security teams gain additional insight into the security posture of their systems.

## Starting with integration
Integrating Semgrep with DefectDojo means dumping findings detected by Semgrep into DefectDojo.
There are several steps to follow:

1. In DefectDojo:
    * Create your product (a product is DefectDojo's concept for a project).
    2. In that DefectDojo product, create an **engagement** called `semgrep`. An engagement is a channel to import results.
2. Run a semgrep scan with flags `--json --output report.json` to generate a JSON report.

Now, there are all the necessary elements to start playing with [DefectDojo API](https://documentation.defectdojo.com/integrations/api-v2-docs/).

### DefectDojo API example 

To run API DefectDojo operations (GET, POST, DELETE, etc..), an API token is necessary. To get it, follow [API guide](https://documentation.defectdojo.com/integrations/api-v2-docs/).

* Once got it in your system, declare the environment variable `DEFECT_DOJO_API_TOKEN`
```
export DEFECT_DOJO_API_TOKEN=xxxxxx
```
Exploring the DefectDojo API, the endpoint is: `/api/v2/import-scan/` for the first import and `/api/v2/reimport-scan` for the following imports.

These endpoints receive some parameters. Mandatory are:
* Semgrep report (JSON format)
* Scan type: `Semgrep JSON Report` for Semgrep importation.
* Product Name (project name)
* Engagement Name (a good practice is to name `semgrep`)

So a Python function using this endpoint can look like this:

```
def uploadToDefectDojo(is_new_import, token, url, product_name, engagement_name, filename):
    multipart_form_data = {
        'file': (filename, open(filename, 'rb')),
        'scan_type': (None, 'Semgrep JSON Report'),
        'product_name': (None, product_name),
        'engagement_name': (None, engagement_name),
    }

    endpoint = '/api/v2/import-scan/' if is_new_import else '/api/v2/reimport-scan/'
    r = requests.post(
        url + endpoint,
        files=multipart_form_data,
        headers={
            'Authorization': 'Token ' + token,
        }
    )
    if r.status_code != 200:
        sys.exit(f'Post failed: {r.text}')
    print(r.text)
```

The full version of this Python script can be found in this [repository](https://github.com/r2c-CSE/semgrep-utilities/blob/main/integrations/defectdojo/import_semgrep_to_defect_dojo.py).
It is ready to execute.

### Running the script

To run the script:
```
python3 integrations/defectdojo/import_semgrep_to_defect_dojo.py --host DOJO_URL --product PRODUCT_NAME --engagement ENGAGEMENT_NAME --report REPORT_FILE 
```
Where:
* `DOJO_URL` is the URL where DefectDojo is.
* `PRODUCT_NAME` is the DefectDojo product name.
* `ENGAGEMENT_NAME` is the DefectDojo engagement name for that product.
* `REPORT_FILE` is the Semgrep report path

## Integrate Semgrep and DefectDojo in a pipeline

From a DevSecOps point of view is crucial to integrate security scans and dump results to DefectDojo in the same pipeline.
An example of GitLab job importing results to DefectDojo taking as input a Semgrep report looks like this:

```
import-semgrep-to-defectdojo:
  stage: import
  image: python:3.9-bullseye
  script:
    - echo "Importing Semgrep scan to DefectDojo"
    - pip3 install requests
    - curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/r2c-CSE/semgrep-utilities/main/integrations/defectdojo/import_semgrep_to_defect_dojo.py
    - python3 import_semgrep_to_defect_dojo.py --host $DEFECTDOJO_URL --product $PRODUCT --engagement semgrep --report report.json || true
  rules:
    # Scan changed files in MRs, (diff-aware scanning):
    - if: $CI_MERGE_REQUEST_IID
    # Scan mainline (default) branches and report all findings.
    - if: $CI_COMMIT_BRANCH == $CI_DEFAULT_BRANCH
  tags:
    - defectdojo
  variables:
    DEFECT_DOJO_API_TOKEN: $DEFECT_DOJO_API_TOKEN
```

### Adding checksum validation
To verify that the job downloads the correct Python script securely, check the integrity with a checksum such as SHA 256 code. It prevents tampered scripts from executing.

```
    - echo $IMPORT_SEMGREP_TO_DEFECTDOJO_SHA_CHECKSUM > sha-import-dd.tmp
    - shasum -a 256 -U -c sha-import-dd.tmp
```
Where:
* `IMPORT_SEMGREP_TO_DEFECTDOJO_SHA_CHECKSUM` is the result of executing `shasum -a 256 -U import_semgrep_to_defect_dojo.py`

## Conclusions
Dumping Semgrep scan results to [DefectDojo](https://www.defectdojo.com/) can speed up vulnerability management operations in an organization. Integrating scans and imports in the same CI pipeline should be a high priority for DevSecOps programs.
